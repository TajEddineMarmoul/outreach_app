# Deployment and operations

This guide describes the hosting model recorded in the repository. Confirm project
settings and scheduler configuration in the hosting dashboards before a release;
those settings are not all managed by checked-in files.

## Services

| Service | Configuration |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend | Vercel project `outreach-web`, rooted at `outreach_web/` |
| API | Vercel project `outreach-api`, using root [server.py](../server.py) and [vercel.json](../vercel.json) |
| Database | Supabase PostgreSQL shared by the API and worker |
| Worker invocation | Supabase `pg_cron` and `pg_net` call `POST /internal/worker/tick` once per minute |

The recorded release path is `main` through the two connected Vercel projects.
The [GCP workflow](../.github/workflows/deploy-gcp.yml) is a manual legacy path;
its [configuration notes](../.github/DEPLOYMENT_SECRETS.md) describe its limitations.
Provider pricing, quotas, and account-specific domains are managed outside this guide.

## Environment reference

### API and standalone worker

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `APP_ENV=production` | Enforce production database, encryption, and authentication behavior. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string used by both data-access layers. |
| `APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Stable key for encrypted Gmail sender credentials; API and worker must match. |
| `APP_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Private token added by the frontend proxy. |
| `APP_USER_ID` | Database workspace owner returned for that token. |
| `BACKEND_URL` | Public API origin, also used for the Gmail OAuth callback. |
| `TRACKING_BASE_URL` | Optional public API origin used in open-pixel and click-redirect links. Defaults to `BACKEND_URL`; set it only when tracking should use a separate public domain. |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | Frontend origin used after OAuth completes. |
| `RUN_DATABASE_MIGRATIONS=false` | Keep API startup migrations off; upgrade explicitly. |
| `OUTREACH_SAFE_LOCAL_MODE=false` | Allow the hosted delivery runtime to process jobs. |
| `WORKER_TICK_TOKEN` | Secret required in the tick request's `X-Worker-Token` header. |
| `WORKER_MAX_JOBS` | Jobs processed per tick; defaults to 25 and is clamped to 1–25. |
| `GMAIL_CREDENTIALS_JSON` | Google OAuth client JSON for a serverless API. |

`APP_DATABASE_URL` overrides the ORM connection only. Prefer `DATABASE_URL` for
the whole application and avoid pointing the two layers at different databases.

For a persistent host, `GMAIL_CREDENTIALS_PATH` can identify the OAuth client JSON
file instead. Sender OAuth tokens are stored encrypted in PostgreSQL by the current
platform. Provision the client configuration before connecting senders; the Gmail
callback is `BACKEND_URL` followed by `/api/oauth/callback`.

### Frontend

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `APP_ENV=production` | Disable the local user-ID authentication path. |
| `BACKEND_URL` | API origin targeted by the server-side proxy. |
| `APP_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Same private token as the API. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Clerk browser configuration. |
| `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` | Matching Clerk server credential. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | Optional public base used to construct API URLs; `useApiClient()` maps matching requests through the proxy. |

Keep private credentials out of `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables. Clerk verifies browser
sessions; the proxy adds the API token on the server. In shared-token mode, signed-in
users reach the workspace identified by `APP_USER_ID`. Account access must reflect
that shared-workspace behavior.

### Optional Gmail activity synchronization

Set `GMAIL_PUBSUB_TOPIC`, `GMAIL_PUBSUB_PUSH_AUDIENCE`, and
`GMAIL_PUBSUB_PUSH_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` on the API/worker when configuring Gmail push
notifications. The push audience identifies the `/api/webhooks/gmail` endpoint.
The worker renews due watches and processes queued notifications. Sender read
permission and a working push subscription are required for ongoing response
updates. These variables alone do not create the topic or subscription.

## Database upgrades

Run Alembic with the intended deployment environment and database, using a backup
and a tested upgrade path:

```bash
python -m alembic current
python -m alembic heads
python -m alembic upgrade head
```

The latest checked-in revision is `0014_email_engagement`. Query `heads` when preparing
a release instead of using an older release note's target. Restart or redeploy the
application after upgrading, and verify its health and authenticated pages.

**Fresh database limitation:** `0001_application_schema` creates tables from the
current ORM metadata, while later revisions also create or alter those objects.
For example, `0005` creates `autopilot_day_schedules` again. The historical release
notes report this failure on an empty PostgreSQL database, and the conflicting code
is still present. An empty-database upgrade is not a verified bootstrap path.
Use an initialized development database or an isolated schema-only copy; do not
stamp an incomplete schema as current to suppress migration errors.

## Worker execution

The API does not start a background delivery thread. The scheduled tick endpoint
recovers stale jobs and runs a bounded worker cycle. Each request needs the matching
`X-Worker-Token`, and delivery must be enabled. Ensure the scheduler continues to run
after API deployment. The checked-in function timeout is 300 seconds.

A persistent host can run `python -m src.platform.worker` instead. This standalone
entry point attempts an Alembic upgrade before its loop; `RUN_DATABASE_MIGRATIONS`
controls API startup only. Local launchers deliberately omit the worker.

For release validation, check the frontend and API commit IDs, `/health`, signed-in
campaign pages, and scheduler results. Test provider transmission through the mocked
delivery suite before any deliberately configured live sending check.
